This repo is just a place for me to put some guitar tabs in versioned text files easily.

Currently just 1 tab, for the Guitar intro to I Will Follow You Into The Dark by Death Cab for Cutie.
I found the original tab online (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U56nXqBPOZQ) and made some adjustments to make it easier to play.
